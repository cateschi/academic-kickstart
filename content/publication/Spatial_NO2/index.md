abstract: "Dutch emissions of nitrogen per hectare are the highest in Europe. Up to 40% of these emissions are made of nitrogen dioxide ($NO_2$) and are due to combustion processes, with on-road vehicles being their primary contributors. $NO_2$ is a pollutant that is responsible for the creation of acid rains and of other secondary pollutants, and can be harmful for the respiratory system. As such, it is a pollutant of concern and modeling its concentration in the Netherlands (measured with satellite data) is of interest. The aim of this paper is to do so at the regional level, by means of a novel spatial lag state space model that takes into account the determinants of $NO_2$ concentration, such as economic activity and meteorological factors, but also the spatial spillovers of $NO_2$ that are due to its transportation by the wind. The model also has the flexibility of allowing for time-varying coefficients and is suited for simulating hypothetical scenarios."

abstract: "Dutch emissions of nitrogen per hectare are the highest in Europe. Up to 40% of these emissions are made of nitrogen oxides ($NO_X$), and are due to combustion processes, with on-road vehicles being their primary contributors. $NO_X$ is an air pollutant that is responsible for the creation of acid rains and of other secondary aerosols and pollutants, and can be harmful for the respiratory system. As such, it is a pollutant of concern and modeling its concentrations in the Netherlands, which are approximated by concentrations of nitrogen dioxide ($NO_2$), is of interest. This paper does so at the regional level, by means of a novel spatial lag state space model that takes into account the determinants of $NO_2$ concentrations, such as traffic intensity and meteorological factors, but also spatial spillovers of $NO_2$ that are due to its transportation by the wind. The model also has the flexibility of allowing for time-varying coefficients, it is efficiently estimated by Kalman filtering/smoothing and maximum likelihood, and it is employed for forecasting $NO_2$ concentrations based on different scenarios of road traffic. We find a static effect of the latter variable on the levels of  $NO_2$ concentration, but we also find time-varying differences in $NO_2$ concentrations between peripheral Dutch regions and inland Dutch regions. Our proposed model realistically forecasts an overall decrease in $NO_2$ concentrations of around 35%, following an hypothetical 100% decrease in traffic intensity with respect to its actual observed values. Such a decrease is gradual and it is predicted to take around eight months for Dutch $NO_2$ concentrations to achieve their new  steady level."

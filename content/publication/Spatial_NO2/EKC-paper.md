abstract = "This paper develops the asymptotic theory of a Fully Modified Generalized Least Squares (FMGLS) estimator for multivariate cointegrating polynomial regressions. Such regressions allow for deterministic trends, stochastic trends and integer powers of stochastic trends to enter the cointegrating relations. As such, they are natural extensions of the linear cointegration framework. Our fully modified estimator relies on: (1) the inverse autocovariance matrix of the multidimensional errors, and (2) second order bias corrections. Both quantities are unknown in practice. The inverse autocovariance matrix of the errors is estimated directly using the modified Cholesky decomposition originally proposed by Pourahmadi (1999). The resulting estimator has the intuitive interpretation of applying a weighted least squares objective function to filtered data series. Moreover, the second order bias corrections are convenient byproducts of our approach, hence avoiding the difficult kernel and bandwidth selections that typically accompany long-run covariance estimation. Overall, our feasible FMGLS estimator allows for standard asymptotic inference. Extending earlier work by Phillips and Park (1988), we elaborate on the conditions that make this FMGLS estimator asymptotically equivalent to its ordinary least squares counterpart. We also extend Wagner and Hong (2016) by providing a new residual-based test for cointegrating polynomial regressions. That is, our KPSS type of test does not use the ordinary residuals but the residuals that have been weighted and filtered by their estimated inverse autocovariance matrix. A comprehensive simulation study shows good performance of the FMGLS estimator and the related tests. In comparison to FMOLS, the FMGLS estimator leads to lower MSEs and improved size and power properties in finite samples. Moreover, the cointegration test exhibits similar nontrivial size and power improvements. As a practical illustration, we test the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis for six early industrialized countries."

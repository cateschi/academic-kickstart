## Linear Gaussian state space model

The linear Gaussian state space model takes the following form:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{y}\_t &= \mathbf{Z} \boldsymbol{\alpha}\_t + \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}\_t, \\qquad  \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}\_t \sim N \left( \mathbf{0}, \mathbf{H} \right) \\\\\\
\boldsymbol{\alpha}\_{t+1} &= \mathbf{T} \boldsymbol{\alpha}\_t + \boldsymbol{\eta}\_t, \\qquad \boldsymbol{\eta}\_t \sim N \left( \mathbf{0}, \mathbf{Q} \right),
\end{aligned}
$$

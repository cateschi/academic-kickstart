I am a PhD candidate in Econometrics at Maastricht University and Statistics Netherlands, under the supervision of Franz Palm, Stephan Smeekes and Jan van den Brakel. My research focuses on time series methods for the production of official statistics and to model air pollutants. Before starting my PhD, I completed an internship in data analysis at the United Nations Refugee Agency.
